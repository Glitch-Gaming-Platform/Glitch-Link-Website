# Link Website for Your Game

Easily create a website that links all your game's digital assets in one place. This includes store fronts (Steam, Itch, Epic, etc.), social media profiles, and pages where users can sign up for playtests and newsletters.

## The Problem

Many games have multiple digital assets that are not easily linked together. When users are researching your game, they may want to explore a variety of information, such as reviews, your community, or your social following. If these digital assets are not easily accessible in one place, it can make it harder for potential players to do their due diligence and could cost you valuable interest.

## Why Host Your Own Link Website?

While there are other solutions for hosting a link website, hosting your own offers three key benefits:

1. **Avoid Being Marked as Spam**  
   Websites like LinkTree are sometimes erroneously flagged as spam by platforms such as Reddit. Hosting your own link website on your domain can reduce the risk of being caught in spam filters.

2. **Analytics Without Extra Costs**  
   Many link-hosting services charge for access to analytics. With this template, you can integrate Google Analytics for free, giving you full access to your data without paying additional fees.

3. **Uniform Branding**  
   Hosting your link website on your own domain or subdomain helps create a consistent and professional branding experience for your game.
